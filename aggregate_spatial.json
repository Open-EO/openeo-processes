The given data cube can have multiple additional dimensions and for all these dimensions results will be computed individually.\n\nAn 'unbounded' aggregation over the full extent of the horizontal spatial dimensions can be computed with the process ``reduce_spatial()``.\n\nThis process passes a list of values to the reducer. The list of values has an undefined order, therefore processes such as ``last()`` and ``first()`` that depend on the order of the values will lead to unpredictable results.",

For a `FeatureCollection` multiple values will be computed, one value per contained `Feature`. No values will be computed for empty geometries. For example, a single value will be computed for a `MultiPolygon`, but two values will be computed for a `FeatureCollection` containing two polygons.\n\n- For **polygons**, the process considers all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC).\n- For **points**, the process considers the closest pixel center.\n- For **lines** (line strings), the process considers all the pixels whose centers are closest to at least one point on the line.\n\nThus, pixels may be part of multiple geometries and be part of multiple aggregations.
