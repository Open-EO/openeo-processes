    "description": "Aggregates statistics for one or more geometries (e.g. zonal statistics for polygons) over the spatial dimensions. This process passes a list of values to the reducer. In contrast, aggregate_spatial_binary() passes two values, which may be better suited for UDFs.\n\n- For **polygons**, the process considers all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC).\n- For **points** and **lines** (line strings), the process considers all the closest pixel centers.\n\nThus, pixels may be part of multiple geometries and be part of multiple aggregations.\n\nThe data cube must have been reduced to only contain two spatial dimensions and a third dimension the values are aggregated for, for example the temporal dimension to get a time series. Otherwise this process fails with the TooManyDimensions error.\n\nThe number of total and valid pixels is returned together with the calculated values.",
