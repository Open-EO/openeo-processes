    "description": "InterTwin version: Applies a focal process to a data cube.\n\nA focal process is a process that works on a 'neighborhood' of pixels. The neighborhood can extend into multiple dimensions, this extent is specified by the `size` argument. It is not only (part of) the size of the input window, but also the size of the output for a given position of the sliding window. The sliding window moves with multiples of `size`.\n\nAn overlap can be specified so that neighborhoods can have overlapping boundaries. This allows for continuity of the output. The overlap region must be included in the data cube or array returned by `process`, but any changed values will be ignored. The missing overlap at the borders of the original data cube is made available as no-data (`null`) in the sub-data cubes.\n\nThe neighborhood size should be kept small enough, to avoid running beyond computational resources, but a too-small size will result in a larger number of process invocations, which may slow down processing. Window sizes for spatial dimensions typically range from 64 to 512 pixels, while overlaps of 8 to 32 pixels are common.\n\nFor the special case of 2D convolution, it is recommended to use ``apply_kernel()``.\nThis implementation makes use of the xarray rolling functionality and slightly differs from the openEO definition. The size and overlap concepts cannot directly be used by xarray rolling, so a kernelsize and stride are computed and used in the processing. Use with caution.",
