    "description": "Applies a mask to a raster data cube. To apply a polygon as a mask, use ``mask_polygon()``.\n\nA mask is a raster data cube for which corresponding pixels among `data` and `mask` are compared and those pixels in `data` are replaced whose pixels in `mask` are non-zero (for numbers) or `true` (for boolean values). The pixel values are replaced with the value specified for `replacement`, which defaults to `null` (no data).\n\nThe data cubes have to be compatible except that the horizontal spatial dimensions (axes `x` and `y`) will be aligned implicitly by ``resample_cube_spatial()``. `data` is the target data cube for resampling and the default parameters of ``resample_cube_spatial()`` apply. All other dimensions in the mask must also be available in the raster data cube with the same name, type, reference system, resolution and labels. Dimensions can be missing in the mask with the result that the mask is applied to each label of the dimension in `data` that is missing in the data cube of the mask. The process fails if there's an incompatibility found between the raster data cube and the mask.",
