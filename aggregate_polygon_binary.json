    "description": "Aggregates zonal statistics for one or multiple polygons over the spatial dimensions. This process passes two values to the reducer. In contrast, ``aggregate_polygon()`` passes a list of values.\n\nThe process considers all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC).\n\nThe data cube must have been reduced to only contain two raster dimensions and a third dimension the values are aggregated for, for example the temporal dimension to get a time series. Otherwise this process fails with the `TooManyDimensions` error.\n\nThe number of total and valid pixels is returned together with the calculated values.",
