## Unreleased / Draft

## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-13

### Added

- New processes in proposal state
    - `fit_curve`
    - `predict_curve`
- `ard_normalized_radar_backscatter` and `sar_backscatter`: Added `options` parameter
- `array_find`: Added parameter `reverse`. [#269](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/269)
- `load_result`:
    - Added ability to load by (signed) URL (supported since openEO API v1.1.0).
    - Added parameters `spatial_extent`, `temporal_extent` and `bands`. [#220](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/220)
- `run_udf`: Exception `InvalidRuntime` added. [#273](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/273)
- A new category "math > statistics" has been added [#277](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/277)

### Changed

- `array_labels`: Allow normal arrays to be passed for which the process returns the indices. [#243](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/243)
- `debug`:
    - Renamed to `inspect`.
    - The log level `error` does not need to stop execution.
    - Added proposals for logging several data types to the implementation guide.

### Removed

- Removed the explicit schema for `raster-cube` in the `data` parameters and return values of `run_udf` and `run_udf_externally`. It's still possible to pass raster-cubes via the "any" data type, but it's discouraged due to scalability issues. [#285](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/285)

### Fixed

- `aggregate_temporal_period`: Clarified which dimension labels are present in the returned data cube. [#274](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/274)
- `ard_surface_reflectance`: The process has been categorized as "optical" instead of "sar".
- `array_modify`: Clarified behavior.
- `save_result`: Clarify how the process works in the different contexts it is used in (e.g. synchronous processing, secondary web service). [#288](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/288)
- `quantiles`:
  - The default algorithm for sample quantiles has been clarified (type 7). [#296](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/296)
  - Improved documentation in general. [#278](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/278)

- Added a guide for implementors that describes numerours implementation details for processes that could not be covered in the specifications itself, for example a recommended implementation for the `if` process. [#246](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/246)

### Changed
- Added `proposals` folder for experimental processes. Experimental processes are not covered by the CHANGELOG and MAY include breaking changes! [#196](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/196), [#207](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/207), [PSC#8](https://github.com/Open-EO/PSC/issues/8)
    - Moved the experimental process `run_udf_externally` to the proposals.
    - Moved the rarely used and implemented processes `cummax`, `cummin`, `cumproduct`, `cumsum`, `debug`, `filter_labels`, `load_result`, `load_uploaded_files`, `resample_cube_temporal` to the proposals.
- Exception messages have been aligned always use ` instead of '. Tooling could render it with CommonMark.
- `load_collection` and `mask_polygon`:Â Also support multi polygons instead of just polygons. [#237](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/237)
- `run_udf` and `run_udf_externally`: Specify specific (extensible) protocols for UDF URIs.
- `resample_cube_spatial` and `resample_spatial`: Aligned with GDAL and added `rms` and `sum` options to methods. Also added better descriptions.
- `resample_cube_temporal`: Process has been simplified and only offers the nearest neighbor method now. The `process` parameter has been removed, the `dimension` parameter was made less restrictive, the parameter `valid_within` was added. [#194](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/194)

### Deprecated
- `GeometryCollection`s are discouraged in all relevant processes.

### Removed

- Removed the experimental processes `aggregate_spatial_binary` and `reduce_dimension_binary`. [#258](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/258)

### Fixed

- Clarify that the `condition` parameter for `array_filter` works also on indices and labels.

- Improve and clarify specifications for `all` and `any`. [#189](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/199)
- `array_element`: Clarify that `ArrayNotLabeled` exception is thrown when parameter `label` is specified and the given array is not labeled.
- `array_apply`, `array_element`, `array_filter`: Added the `minimum: 0` constraint to all schemas describing zero-based indices (parameter `index`).
- `array_labels`: Clarified the accepted data type for array elements passed to the parameter `data`.
- `merge_cubes`: Clarified the dimension label order after the merge. [#212](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/212)
- `merge_cubes`: Clarified the fourth example. [#266](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/266)

- Clarified that UDF source code must contain a newline/line-break (affects `run_udf`).
- `aggregate_spatial`, `aggregate_spatial_binary`: Clarified that Features, Geometries and GeometryCollections are a single entity in computations. Only FeatureCollections are multiple entities. [#252](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/252)

- `load_collection`, parameter `spatial_extent`: Clarified that all pixels that are inside the bounding box of the given polygons but do not intersect with any polygon have to be set to no-data (`null`). [#256](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/256)
- `load_collection`: Clarified that the parameters are recommended to be used in favor of `filter_*` processes.
- `aggregate_temporal` and `aggregate_temporal_period`: Clarified that reducers are also executed for intervals/periods with no data. [#263](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/263)

- `count`: Renamed parameter `expression` to `condition`.
- `debug`: Replaced with a completely new definition. [#82](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/71), [API#100](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/100), [API#214](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/214)
- `filter_bands`: Merged parameters `bands` and `common_names`. [#77](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/77)
- `if`:
    - Doesn't pass through `null`, but instead `null` leads to rejecting the condition.
    - Parameter `expression` renamed to `value`.
    - Parameter `accept` is required.

- `ndvi` and `normalized_difference`: Rewrite of the processes with a completely new behavior. [#60](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/60)
- `not`: Parameter `expression` renamed to `x`.
- `resample_spatial`: Default value of parameter `align` changed from `lower-left` to `upper-left`. [#61](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/61)
- The following operations work on two values instead on a sequence of values: `and`, `divide`, `multiply`, `or`, `subtract`, `xor`. [#85](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/85)
- `product` works as before, but is not an alias of `multiply` any longer. [#85](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes/issues/85)
