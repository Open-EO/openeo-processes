# openEO processes

openEO develops interoperable processes for big Earth observation cloud processing. This repository contains the process specifications. Each process is specified in a separate JSON file, which conforms to the corresponding API process schema.

## Versions

The openEO processes are currently released as version [**0.4.2**](http://processes.openeo.org/0.4.2).

**This branch is the development branch!**

**Note:** The specification is currently still an early version, with the potential for some major things to change. The core is now fleshed out, so implementors are encouraged to try it out and give feedback. But the goal is to actually be able to act on that feedback, which will mean changes are quite possible. A solid basis is specified right now, but best practices, extensions and specification details will emerge with implementation.
