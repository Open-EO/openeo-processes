# Phenology example

This example uses a Jupyter notebook to show a complete workflow based on openEO. The main file is the notebook: Phenology.ipynb, the 'udf' folder contains user defined functions used by the notebook.

The notebook is rendered by GitHub, or you can use a service like https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to show the contents. It was tested against the VITO Geopyspark backend.
