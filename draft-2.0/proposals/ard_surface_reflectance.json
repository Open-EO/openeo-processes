Depending on the methods used, several additional bands will be added to the data cube:\n\n- `date` (optional): Specifies per-pixel acquisition timestamps.\n- `incomplete-testing` (required): Identifies pixels with a value of 1 for which the per-pixel tests (at least saturation, cloud and cloud shadows, see CARD4L specification for details) have not all been successfully completed. Otherwise, the value is 0.\n- `saturation` (required) / `saturation_{band}` (optional): Indicates where pixels in the input spectral bands are saturated (1) or not (0). If the saturation is given per band, the band names are `saturation_{band}` with `{band}` being the band name from the source data cube.\n- `cloud`, `shadow` (both required),`aerosol`, `haze`, `ozone`, `water_vapor` (all optional): Indicates the probability of pixels being an atmospheric disturbance such as clouds. All bands have values between 0 (clear) and 1, which describes the probability that it is an atmospheric disturbance.\n- `snow-ice` (optional): Points to a file that indicates whether a pixel is assessed as being snow/ice (1) or not (0). All values describe the probability and must be between 0 and 1.\n- `land-water` (optional): Indicates whether a pixel is assessed as being land (1) or water (0). All values describe the probability and must be between 0 and 1.\n- `incidence-angle` (optional): Specifies per-pixel incidence angles in degrees.\n- `azimuth` (optional): Specifies per-pixel azimuth angles in degrees.\n- `sun-azimuth:` (optional): Specifies per-pixel sun azimuth angles in degrees.\n- `sun-elevation` (optional): Specifies per-pixel sun elevation angles in degrees.\n- `terrain-shadow` (optional): Indicates with a value of 1 whether a pixel is not directly illuminated due to terrain shadowing. Otherwise, the value is 0.\n- `terrain-occlusion` (optional): Indicates with a value of 1 whether a pixel is not visible to the sensor due to terrain occlusion during off-nadir viewing. Otherwise, the value is 0.\n- `terrain-illumination` (optional): Contains coefficients used for terrain illumination correction are provided for each pixel.\n\nThe data returned is CARD4L compliant with corresponding metadata.",
