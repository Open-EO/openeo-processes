Dimension labels: `1` - `12`\r\n* `yearly`: Number of the year. Dimension labels are the four-digit year numbers.\r\n* `single_period` / `climatology_period`: A single period, e.g. the climatology period. A single dimension label with any name is expected.\r\n* `seasons`: Refers to three month periods of the calendar seasons (winter, spring, summer, autumn). Dimension labels: `djf` (December - February), `mam` (March - May), `jja` (June - August), `son` (September - November).\r\n* `tropical_seasons`: Refers to the 6 month periods of the tropical seasons (dry, wet).
