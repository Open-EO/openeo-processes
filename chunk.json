    "description": "Data cubes can not be loaded into memory, so various processes need to work on smaller subsets of the data. While some processes can work on all values for one dimension, this might still be too much. This process defines how the larger datacube should be divided into smaller chunks, without modifying the data. Subsequent processes will then take this into account.\n Chunks are also allowed to overlap, by specifying a 'padding'.",
