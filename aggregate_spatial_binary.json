    "description": "Aggregates statistics for one or more geometries (e.g. zonal statistics for polygons) over the spatial dimensions. This process consecutively passes a pair of values to the reducer. This may be better suited especially for UDFs in case the number of values gets too large to be processed at once. In contrast, ``aggregate_spatial()`` passes a list of values.\n\n- For **polygons**, the process considers all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC).\n- For **points**, the process considers the closest pixel center.\n- For **lines** (line strings), the process considers all the pixels whose centers are closest to at least one point on the line.\n\nThe data cube must have been reduced to only contain two raster dimensions and a third dimension the values are aggregated for, for example the temporal dimension to get a time series. Otherwise this process fails with the `TooManyDimensions` error.\n\nThe number of total and valid pixels is returned together with the calculated values.",
