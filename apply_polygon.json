For each polygon provided, all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC) are collected into sub data cubes. If a pixel is part of multiple of the provided polygons (e.g., when the polygons overlap), the `GeometriesOverlap` exception is thrown. Each sub data cube is passed individually to the given process.",
