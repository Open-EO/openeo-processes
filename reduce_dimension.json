    "description": "Applies a unary reducer to a data cube dimension by collapsing all the pixel values along the specified dimension into an output value computed by the reducer. This process passes a list of values to the reducer. In contrast, ``reduce_dimension_binary()`` passes two values, which may be better suited for UDFs.\n\nThe dimension is dropped. To avoid this, use ``apply_dimension()`` instead.",
