Required bands are `B03`, `B04`, `B05`, `B06`, `B07`, `B8A`, `B11`, `B12`, as well as the solar and viewing azimuth and zenith angles `SAA`, `SZA`, `VAA`, `VZA`. Note that the expected output values are in the range of [0, 1] and values outside of the range need to be considered as invalid. To keep the dimension specify a new band name in the parameter `target_band`. This adds a new dimension label with the specified name to the dimension, which can be used to access the computed values. If a band with the specified name exists, a `BandExists` is thrown.",
