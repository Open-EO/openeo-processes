The UDF container must follow the [openEO UDF specification](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/udfs.html).\n\nThe referenced UDF service can be executed in several processes such as ``aggregate_spatial()``, ``apply()``, ``apply_dimension()`` and ``reduce_dimension()``. In this case, an array is passed instead of a data cube. The user must ensure that the data is provided in a way that the UDF code can make sense of it.",
