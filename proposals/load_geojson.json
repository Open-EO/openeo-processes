There are as many values and labels per geometry as there are for the largest array.\n- Multiple properties with scalar values: The dimension labels correspond to the property names. There are as many values and labels per geometry as there are properties provided here.\n\nMissing values are generally set to the no-data value of the data cube.\n\nAlthough mixing data types of values is generally allowed, certain combinations of data type may be unsupported by some implementations.
