    "description": "Splits a single dimension into multiple dimensions by systematically extracting values and splitting the dimension labels by the given `label_separator`. This process is the opposite of the process ``flatten_dimensions()`` but executing both processes subsequently doesn't necessarily create a data cube that is equal to the original data cube.\n\nExample: Executing the process with a data cube with one dimension `X` (labels: `2020~B1`, `2020~B2`, `2021~B1` and `2021~B2`) and the data `[1,2,3,4]` and the parameters `dimension` = `X` and `target_dimensions` = `[A,B]` will result in a data cube with two dimensions `A` (labels: `2020` and `2021`) and B (labels: `B1` and `B2`) and the data `[[1,2],[3,4]]`.",
