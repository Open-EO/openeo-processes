If the centroid is not enclosed in the polygon, no point is sampled, which results in an empty geometry.\n- For **lines** (line strings), the sampling starts with a point at the first coordinate of the line and then walks along the line and samples a new point each time the distance to the previous point has been reached again.\n- For **points**, the point is returned as given.",
