    "description": "Applies a binary reducer to a data cube dimension by collapsing all the pixel values along the specified dimension into an output value computed by the reducer. This process consecutively passes a pair of values to the reducer. This may be better suited especially for UDFs in case the number of values gets too large to be processed at once. In contrast, ``reduce_dimension()`` passes a list of values.\n\nThe dimension is dropped. To avoid this, use ``apply_dimension()`` instead.",
