    "description": "Loads data from a static STAC catalog or a STAC API Collection and returns the data as a processable data cube. A batch job result can be loaded by providing a reference to it.\n\nIf supported by the underlying metadata and file format, the data that is added to the data cube can be restricted with the parameters `spatial_extent`, `temporal_extent` and `bands`. If no data is available for the given extents, a `NoDataAvailable` exception is thrown.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\n* The bands (and all dimensions that specify nominal dimension labels) are expected to be ordered as specified in the metadata if the `bands` parameter is set to `null`.\n* If no additional parameter is specified this would imply that the whole data set is expected to be loaded. Due to the large size of many data sets, this is not recommended and may be optimized by back-ends to only load the data that is actually required after evaluating subsequent processes such as filters. This means that the values should be processed only after the data has been limited to the required extent and as a consequence also to a manageable size.",
