    "description": "Aggregates zonal statistics for one or multiple polygons over the spatial dimensions. This process passes a list of values to the reducer. In contrast, ``aggregate_polygon_binary()`` passes two values, which may be better suited for UDFs.\n\nThe process considers all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC).\n\nThe data cube must have been reduced to only contain two spatial dimensions and a third dimension the values are aggregated for, for example the temporal dimension to get a time series. Otherwise this process fails with the `TooManyDimensions` error.\n\nThe number of total and valid pixels is returned together with the calculated values.",
